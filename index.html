		<p>Oliver Goldsmith once said "Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accomodations". When I was growing up, I always watched Disney movies hoping that one day my Prince Charming would sweep me off my feet and I would have my happily ever after. It turns out that life can make that dream seem so impossible at times. All of the trials and tribulations we face make us feel an abundance of emotions that we sometimes don't know exist until they happen. </p>
